notes:

Sergio wants to include adjectives of words.

What adjectives to include?
	Include everything?
	Filter using weights?

Neural net like structure to provide feedback to the backend.
	problems:
		exceptions
		not build for using NN
	advantages
		can filter and adjust bad descriptions over time

Other observations:
	what to do with CO2 and Carbon emissions?
		it is nearly the same but are we gonna adjust the descriptions or add new descriptions


Testing
	In-Between design?
